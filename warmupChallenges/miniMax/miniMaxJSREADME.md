## Description
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

For example, `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`

The minimum sum is `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16` and the maximum sum is `3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24`. The function prints `16 24`

miniMaxSum has the following parameter(s):

- `arr`: an array of  integers

Prints:
- `int` x2: two space-separated integers on one line: the minimum sum and the maximum sum.
